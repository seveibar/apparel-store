# Apparel Store Client

> This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

Run `yarn install` and `yarn start`

You will need the server running simultaneously on `http://localhost:3001` for
server-side functions to work.

## Notes

- The payment method should include more `billing_details`
- It's better to verify Payment Intents client-side [(using the client_secret)](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-intents#passing-to-client)
